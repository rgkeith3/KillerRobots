## a repository of pd patches

### Introduction

some of the patches are my own work, while others are implementations of patches I made while learning pd, taken from pd-tutorial, with my own additions.

in the vien of Automatonism, these patches communicate via bangs signals (clocks, triggers), gates (toggles - 1 or 0 signals), control signal (floats from 0 - 1), and audio signal (floats -1 - 1 at audio sample rate).

generally, most controls are controllable with control signal and are controlled by the inlets on top (left to right, top to bottom).

I've tried to pack as much as I can into each patch and will include help patches for each one, However if you look in the patches them selves, they may be very messy. I'm sorry but mostly wanted to get them done.
